This is the repository for the Physics Matters McGill website, https://physicsmattersmcgill.github.io/physicsmattersmcgill

This README is meant to help someone to update the Physics Matters website. This website was built using the [Feeling Responsive template](http://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/).

# Adding a page or changing the navigation menu
The data for the navigation menu (page names, what goes in each menu) goes in the folder `_data/navigation.yml`.

To make a new page, add a new markdown file under the `pages/` folder. See existing pages for examples and the front matter to use.

Each page must have an English and French title and url in the `_data/navigation.yml` file in order for the menus to work for both English and French versions of the site. The urls provided in this file should match the permalinks in the frontmatter of the corresponding pages. There should be two files for each page, one in English and one in French. If you cannot translate a new page, the French/English version can be a copy of the English/French version, maybe with a short statement at the top ("Cette page n'est pas disponsible en fran√ßais en ce moment. Voici en Anglais." or similar.)

# Images  
Any images used on the site should be added to the `physics-matters/images` folder on the physics department server. Please do not put pictures for the website on github.

Images to be used as thumbnails should be sized to be 150x150 pixels. (Try to make the image as square as possible so that the event list looks consistent. If you really need a rectangular image, then set the width to 150 pixels, and the height can be a little flexible.) It is convenient if the filename for thumbnail images starts or ends with `thumb` so that it is easy to tell which are small thumbnail images and therefore should not be used for larger slots on the website.

For very large images, it may be useful to scale down the size for the version shown on the website. Although this reduces the quality, it will help the page load faster.

# Adding an event
New events are added as elements of a jekyll collection - this is called the events collection. Each event has its own markdown file (extension: `.md`) in the `_events` folder which marks it as part of the collection.

## Naming convention for the markdown files
To help things stay organized: for all events, please include the date as first part of the file name using the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

For a Physics Matters public lecture, start the event with `lecture-`. For example, this might be the filename for a public lecture: `lecture-YYYY-MM-DD-shorttopicname.md`. Note that the McPherson lectures should not be in this category, since they are another program, and have their own page.

Each of the events has frontmatter which will help define it as an event and make sure the style and formatting is consistent on the website. The frontmatter is in between the three dashes (`---` both above and below). Here is the frontmatter for an event (comments after `#` are ignored by jekyll and are there to explain the field)
```
  layout: event
  title: Event Title
  meta_description: Short description that goes on the event listing page. Note: Do NOT use the full abstract - it is too long! Break up the title if it's long and/or use 1-2 sentences from the abstract.
  speaker: Speaker Name (Affiliation of Speaker)
  speaker_url: website_URL #delete this line if no website
  event-date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM  #date of the event - the format is important!
  location: the Keys Auditorium (Rutherford Physics Building, room 112), McGill University  #this will probably be the same for all lectures
  image:
      title: lecture_hall_empty.jpg #Use this as default if no image is given
      thumb: thumb_lecture_hall_empty.jpg #Use this as default if no image is given
      caption: Image from ... #If there's an image credit, add it here. If not, delete this line
  type: lecture   #if this is lecture, then the event will show up on the public lecture page, otherwise it will only show up on the event page
  tags:   # Add tags as a list, for example,
    - particle physics
    - biophysics
    - climate
    - nanotechnology
    - etc.
  #
  # Styling
  #
  header: no   #turns off the header image (the title image is placed at the top of the page instead of a header)
  mediaplayer: false
  ```
  Finally, add a description of the event in the markdown file. Feel free to use any markdown styling (see examples.)

# Adding new Partners
The partners.md file contains links to partners. These should be added as a list in the frontmatter. Each partner must include a link, and may include either a logo or text. It could also include both (useful in cases where the logo doesn't include the name of the group/partner.) Each new partner gets a new `-` in the `links` list. For example,
```
links:
  - url: http://www.astro.physics.mcgill.ca/outreach.php
    logo: partnerlogo_AstroMcGill.png
```

# Testing a local copy of the website
You can test the site locally by running
```
$ jekyll serve
```
This will still look for the images at the specified location on the department server as defined in `_config.yml`. If you want to temporarily use a local images folder, you can temporarily use a different configuration file:
```
$ jekyll serve --config _config_dev.yml
```
This configuration file uses a local folder to look for images. You may need to grab all the images from the department server in order to fully test the website locally.
