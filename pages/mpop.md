# What is MPOP?

The McGill Physics Olympiad Program is a student-run initiative which aims to prepare high school and CEGEP students in the Montreal area, who are passionate about physics, for prestigious competitions, such as the Sir Isaac Newton exam, Canadian Association of Physicists (CAP) exam, Canadian Physics Olympiad (CPO), and the International Physics Olympiad (IPhO).

# How does it Work?

Sessions of 2-3 hours in length will be held every week. Lectures will cover advanced physics concepts and include problem solving sessions to help students fully understand each topic covered. Students will be assigned challenge homework problems, some of which will be taken up in the next lecture; solving the problems is ultimately the responsibility of the student.

# How much does it cost?

MPOP is free of charge! If you’re a CEGEP/high-school student who is passionate about physics and would like to learn more than what’s taught in their physics classes, then you are more than welcome to join!

# How to join?

Fill out this [form]([https://goo.gl/forms/iS3XOV2AWvSB1NFp2).
We will get back to you shortly after you have submitted the form.
Note that if demand is too high, there may be an “entrance exam” to accept qualified students.

# Who are we?

Abtin Ameri is a Mechanical Engineering student minoring in Physics (class of 2020). He scored fifth on the 2016 CAP Exam, giving him the opportunity to compete in the Canadian Physics Olympiad in Vancouver. Abtin believes in the importance of MPOP as it gives an additional boost to students who are preparing for prestigious physics competitions. It also gives the students an opportunity to meet other like-minded people who share the same passion as them.

Vincent Van Duong is an Honours Mathematics and Physics major (class of 2020) at McGill and has graduated from Marianopolis College in Montreal.  Vincent received the highest score in Quebec and the ninth best score in Canada for the 2016 CAP examination.  He was invited to the national finals at the University of British Columbia for the CPO.  As Vincent is from Montreal originally, he supports this initiative because Quebec students are underrepresented at physics Olympiads.
