The outreach group in the Department of Physics at McGill University aims to communicate the excitement and fascination of physics to the public, in classrooms, and other interested groups. Contact us for information about school visits, teacher information, or other collaborations.

# Interested in volunteering?

The Physics Outreach group is always happy to count on more volunteers. To the question 'Why should I take precious time off my research to do physics outreach?', here are a couple of answers:

- Help inform the public about the importance of physics in the real world.
- Be a positive role model for kids and teenagers interested in science
- Develop strong science communication skills.
- Broaden your network and opens doors to alternate career paths after graduation.
- Practice your French, as we do activities in both languages.

Interested? Send an email to outreach@physics.mcgill.ca and we will add you to the physics outreach mailing list where you will hear about planning meetings and volunteer opportunities.
