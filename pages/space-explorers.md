In this program, pairs of physicists visit local primary schools 5 times over the course of the school year, bringing along a different physics activity on each hour-long visit. Students get to know a physicist, while doing educational activities and experiments. Students participating in this program will play with physics concepts like gravity, collisions, and heat. They will also practice using scientific tools like modeling, collecting data, and analyzing results.

The current program may include:
- Heat & temperature
- Collisions
- Gravity
- Magnetism
- Light & Color
- Sink or Float
- Forces & Friction (New)
